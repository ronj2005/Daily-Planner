*Purpose*

*   This daily planner was created as a technical practice of dom manipulation.

* To create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 

* This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


The goal for this daily planner is to continue as part of a group of projects used to build upon multiple application with varying functions and features to eventualy include into future projects as well as my active portfolio.
